# M-Dl - Multi downloader tool

This tool transitions the usage of aria2c and yt-dlp from command line to GUI.
With BitTorrent, the tool only downloads and does not seed.

## Usage
This is a portable version, no installation needed, run the file M-Dl.exe directly.

This tool uses the following softwares: aria2c, yt-dlp and ffmpeg.

You can find and download at the following link:

* aria2c [https://aria2.github.io/](https://aria2.github.io/)
* yt-dlp [https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
* ffmpeg [https://ffmpeg.org/](https://ffmpeg.org/) or [yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds)


Or they are automatically downloaded to the latest version when selecting the About > Check Support update button,
they are downloaded according to the following links:
* aria2c: [https://github.com/aria2/aria2/releases/latest](https://github.com/aria2/aria2/releases/latest)
* yt-dlp: [https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest)
* ffmpeg: [https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/latest](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/latest)

All three files aria2c.exe, yt-dlp.exe and ffmpeg.exe must be placed in the directory declared in Options > Support software directory. By default, the Support folder is at the same level as the M-Dl.exe file.
