# M-Dl - Multi downloader tool

This tool transitions the usage of aria2c and yt-dlp from command line to GUI.
With BitTorrent, the tool only downloads and does not seed.

## Usage
This is a portable version, no installation needed, run the file M-Dl.exe directly.

This tool uses the following software: aria2c, yt-dlp and ffmpeg.
